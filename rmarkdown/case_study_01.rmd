## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
beers <- read.csv('..\\datasets\\Beers.csv')
breweries <- read.csv('..\\datasets\\Breweries.csv')
head(beers)
dim(beers)
head(breweries)
dim(breweries)

```


```{r}
count(breweries, "State")
view(breweries, "State")
table(breweries$State)

```

#2) Merge beer data with breweries data. Print first 6 observations and last 6 observations (not included in ppt deck)
#check column names
```{r}
colnames(beers)
colnames(breweries)
#Fix beer dataset column name so that it matches the brewery dataset column name (merged by the brewery/brew ID)
colnames(beers)[colnames(beers)=="Brewery_id"] <- "Brew_ID"
colnames(beers)

```
```{r}
merged_beer <- merge(breweries, beers, by="Brew_ID")
str(merged_beer)
```
#Print first 6 and last 6 observations
```{r}

head(merged_beer, n=6)
tail(merged_beer, n=6)
```
#3) Address the missing values in each column
#Find NA values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(merged_beer))
#I assume we should remove the NA value since it only reports ABV and IBU units...delete if not
merged_beer <- na.omit(merged_beer)
colSums(is.na(merged_beer))
```
#4) Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. 
#Plot a bar chart to compare.
```{r}
IBU <- merged_beer %>% na.omit() %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(Median=median(IBU)) %>% arrange(Median)
ABV <- merged_beer %>% na.omit() %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(Median=median(ABV)) %>% arrange(Median)
```
#Bar plot for median IBU per state
```{r}
ggplot(data = IBU, aes(x=State, y=Median)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "light blue") +
  theme_clean() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Median IBU") + ggtitle("Median IBUs per State")
```
#Bar plot of median ABV per state
```{r}
ggplot(data = ABV, aes(x=State, y=Median)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "light blue") +
  theme_clean() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Median ABV") + ggtitle("Median ABV per State")
```
#5)Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer?
#Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

```{r}
merged_beer[which.max(merged_beer$ABV),]
```
```{r}
merged_beer[which.max(merged_beer$IBU),]
```
#6) Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
```{r}
summary(merged_beer$ABV)
```
#There is a wide range of ABV beers, ranging from low (0.027) to high (0.125).
#The median ABV and mean are close, which could indicate that the distribution of ABV is symmetrical

#8) Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? 
#Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.
```{r}
ggplot(data = merged_beer, mapping=aes(x=merged_beer$ABV, y=merged_beer$IBU)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(formula = y~x,  method = lm) + ggtitle("Bitterness of Beer vs Alcohol Content") +
  xlab("ABV (%)") + ylab("IBU") 
```
#There appears to be a positive correlation between ABV and IBU. I.e., as IBU increases,
#so too does the alcohol content.
